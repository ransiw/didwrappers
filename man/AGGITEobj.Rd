\arguments{
\item{overall.att}{The estimated overall ATT}

\item{overall.se}{Standard error for overall ATT}

\item{type}{Which type of aggregated treatment effect parameter to compute.
One option is "simple" (this just computes a weighted average of all
group-time average treatment effects with weights proportional to group
size).  Other options are "dynamic" (this computes average effects across
different lengths of exposure to the treatment and is similar to an
"event study"; here the overall effect averages the effect of the
treatment across all positive lengths of exposure); "group" (this
is the default option and
computes average treatment effects across different groups; here
the overall effect averages the effect across different groups); and
"calendar" (this computes average treatment effects across different
time periods; here the overall effect averages the effect across each
time period).}

\item{type2}{the second type of aggregator}

\item{egt}{Holds the length of exposure (for dynamic effects), the
group (for selective treatment timing), the unit (for selective treatment),
cohort (for cohort level effects), or the time period (for calendar
time effects)}

\item{egt2}{a second aggregation type to hold a secondary object, NULL if no such object}

\item{att.egt}{The ATT specific to egt}

\item{se.egt}{The standard error specific to egt}

\item{crit.val.egt}{A critical value for computing uniform confidence
bands for dynamic effects, selective treatment timing, or time period
effects.}

\item{inf.function}{The influence function of the chosen aggregated parameters}

\item{min_e}{For event studies, this is the smallest event time to compute
dynamic effects for.  By default, \code{min_e = -Inf} so that effects at
all lengths of exposure are computed.}

\item{max_e}{For event studies, this is the largest event time to compute
dynamic effects for.  By default, \code{max_e = Inf} so that effects at
all lengths of exposure are computed.}

\item{balance_e}{If set (and if one computes dynamic effects), it balances
the sample with respect to event time.  For example, if \code{balance.e=2},
\code{aggite} will drop groups that are not exposed to treatment for
at least three periods. (the initial period when \code{e=0} as well as the
next two periods when \code{e=1} and the \code{e=2}).  This ensures that
the composition of groups does not change when event time changes.}

\item{call}{The function call to aggite2}

\item{DIDparams}{A DIDparams_i object}
}
